## Installation
The update system has been changed. Before upgrading to 0.11.x, please run the legacy updater one last time using the Admin Dashboard or by running the command `php z_framework/updater.php` in the root directory of your project.

Make sure that you have pulled the latest version of 0.10.x before running the legacy updater.
